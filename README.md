# Account Management Microservice (AccountMS)

## Description

This microservice is responsible for the creation, query, and management of bank accounts associated with customers. It allows creating accounts, making deposits and withdrawals, and retrieving information about existing accounts.

## Endpoints

### Bank Account Management

- **POST /cuentas**: Creates a new bank account for a customer.
- **GET /cuentas/{id}**: Retrieves the details of a bank account by its ID.
- **PUT /cuentas/{cuentaId}/depositar**: Makes a deposit into a bank account.
- **PUT /cuentas/{cuentaId}/retirar**: Makes a withdrawal from a bank account.
- **DELETE /cuentas/{id}**: Deletes a bank account.

### Interaction with TransactionMS

- **GET /byAccountNumber/{accountNumber}**: Retrieves account details by account number received from **TransactionMS**.
- **POST /tDeposit**: Receives deposit information from **TransactionMS** and processes the deposit in the specified account.
- **POST /tWithdrawal**: Receives withdrawal information from **TransactionMS** and processes the withdrawal in the specified account.
  
## Business Rules

- The initial balance of a bank account must be greater than 0.
- Withdrawals cannot leave the balance of a savings account negative.
- Checking accounts can have an overdraft of up to -500.
- **Account Type**: A customer must specify the type of account when opening a new account (Savings or Checking).
- **Customer Validation**: When opening a new bank account, the system must verify that the customer exists.
- **Unique Account Number**: The account number must be unique and automatically generated by the system (either through a sequence or a random identifier).

## Account Creation Logic

To ensure that a bank account can only be created for an existing customer, the **AccountMS** uses **RestTemplate** to interact with the **CustomerMS** microservice. When an account creation request is made, **AccountMS** first sends a request to **CustomerMS** to verify if the customer exists.

- If the customer does not exist, the account creation is blocked, and no account will be created.
- If the customer exists, the system proceeds to create the account and automatically generates a unique account number.

This approach ensures that accounts are only created for valid, existing customers, maintaining data integrity and preventing the creation of accounts for non-existent customers.
